Optional Additions (S3 + Neptune oriented)

These are optional enhancements you can add incrementally for robustness, observability, and maintainability. Enable as needed.

- Infrastructure (CI/CD and IaC)
  - GitHub Actions for lint/tests on pull requests
  - CDK/Terraform to provision S3/Neptune with least-privilege IAM

- Docker/runtime
  - Harden images and use multi-stage builds
  - Compose profiles for dev vs prod under infra/docker and infra/compose

- Config management
  - Environment-variable overrides for configs/default.yaml
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets (no plaintext in code)

- Data/ETL robustness
  - Pydantic validation in src/etl/harmonize.py
  - Retry/backoff and caching for PubMed in src/data/pubmedkg.py
  - Checkpointed incremental loads

- Neptune loading
  - Idempotent upserts for nodes/edges
  - Bulk loader integration and loader JSON artifact
  - Document schema conventions in src/etl/schema.md

- Observability
  - Structured JSON logs in src/utils/logging.py
  - OpenTelemetry traces/metrics across api, ETL, and loaders

- Retrieval/embeddings
  - Embedding cache and standardized chunking
  - Small eval harness for retrieval quality in src/retrieval

- API/UI
  - Minimal endpoints in src/api/app.py for QA/graph queries
  - Lightweight explorer in src/ui to visualize subgraphs and evidence

- Testing
  - Unit tests for utils, retrieval, and ETL
  - Tiny synthetic datasets in tests/

- Security
  - IAM least privilege for S3/Neptune
  - Request signing and network controls
  - No plaintext keys in code
